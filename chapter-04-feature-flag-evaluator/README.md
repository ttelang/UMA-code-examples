# Chapter 4: Feature Flag Evaluator

This chapter example shows how UMA service anatomy can stay portable and deterministic. The validated reader path is Rust-first: a pure Rust core plus a WASI CLI. A parallel TypeScript implementation is kept in parity so readers can compare the same contract and rule semantics across languages.

## Functional Requirements
- Phased release of new features
- Rolling back features or changes
- conducting A/B experiementation



Quality tier: 
- Deterministic hashing is identical across runtimes. 
- p50 latency under 1 ms for a single evaluation on commodity hardware. 

Resource budget: 
- No more than 4 MB memory. 
- No more than 2 ms CPU per evaluation. 

## Learning path position

- You are here: the first hands-on UMA chapter
- Next: [Chapter 5: Post Fetcher Runtime](../chapter-05-post-fetcher-runtime/README.md)

## Key concepts

- one UMA contract defines the evaluator boundary
- rule semantics belong in the portable service logic, not in the host
- deterministic rollout behavior must stay stable across runtimes
- parity should be proven from observable output, not inferred from shared intent

## Prerequisites

- Rust with the `wasm32-wasip1` target: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`
- `wasmtime` on your `PATH`
- Node.js 20 or newer for the TypeScript parity path
- `npm` for the TypeScript parity path and optional browser or cloud adapter exploration

## Quick start

Run the validated Chapter 4 reader path:

```bash
cargo test --locked -p ff_eval_core
./scripts/smoke_flag_labs.sh
```

This smoke path will:

- build the WASI evaluator
- run the Rust unit tests
- run the TypeScript parity tests
- execute the vector suite
- compare Rust and TypeScript outputs across the guided labs

List the available labs:

```bash
./scripts/list_labs.sh
```

Run a specific lab with the Rust evaluator:

```bash
./scripts/run_lab.sh lab2-rollout-match
```

Run the same lab with the TypeScript implementation:

```bash
./scripts/run_lab.sh --impl ts lab2-rollout-match
```

Check Rust and TypeScript parity across every lab:

```bash
./scripts/compare_impls.sh
```

## Validation status

- Rust is the validated default path
- TypeScript is a maintained parity implementation used in tests and smoke checks
- browser, edge, and cloud adapters remain illustrative host examples around the same evaluator contract
- `./scripts/smoke_flag_labs.sh` is the Chapter 4 acceptance path used during repo-level validation

## Reader path

Use this order if you are following Chapter 4 as a first-time reader:

1. `./scripts/list_labs.sh`
2. `./scripts/run_lab.sh lab1-country-match`
3. `./scripts/run_lab.sh lab2-rollout-match`
4. `./scripts/run_lab.sh lab3-default-fallback`
5. `./scripts/run_lab.sh lab4-rule-language`
6. `./scripts/compare_impls.sh`

Expected satisfaction point:
- by the end of lab 4, you should be able to explain how one contract, one deterministic evaluator, and one output shape stay aligned across both implementations

## Questions a reader might ask

### "What am I supposed to learn from this?"

You should leave this lab able to explain:

- what belongs in the evaluator contract versus in a host adapter
- why rollout behavior must stay deterministic and portable
- how Rust and TypeScript can stay aligned when the contract and output semantics remain stable

### "What should I pay attention to in the output?"

The most important signals are:

- `enabled`
- `matchedRule`
- the same lab producing the same decision in both implementations

### "How do I know if the lab gave me value?"

You got value from the Chapter 4 lab if you can explain all three of these points after running it:

- the evaluator is portable because the rule engine is pure and host-independent
- rollout decisions are sticky for the same `flag.key` and `userId`
- parity between Rust and TypeScript is being proven from output, not assumed from similar code

## Hands-on flow

The guided lab inputs live in [labs/README.md](labs/README.md).

- `lab1-country-match`: first-match-wins on a direct country rule
- `lab2-rollout-match`: deterministic sticky rollout
- `lab3-default-fallback`: no rule matches, so the default is returned
- `lab4-rule-language`: demonstrates `in`, numeric comparison, and logical operators

## Contract (v1)

The evaluator accepts an **input JSON** document with a flag definition and a context. It produces an **output JSON** document describing whether the flag is enabled and which rule matched.

### Input

```json
{
  "flag": {
    "key": "paywall",
    "rules": [
      { "if": "country == 'CA'", "then": true },
      { "if": "rollout(0.20)", "then": true }
    ],
    "default": false
  },
  "context": {
    "userId": "u123",
    "country": "CA",
    "appVersion": "1.4.2"
  }
}
```

- flag -> Key: unique identifier for the feature flag. 
- variants: possible values the flag can return. 
- weights: optional distribution for randomized rollout. 
- rules: optional conditions for targeting (e.g., “if country == CA, serve variant B”).

### Output

```json
{
  "key": "paywall",
  "enabled": true,
  "matchedRule": 0
}
```

Outpus: 
- key: the same identifier passed in.
- variant: the chosen outcome. 
- reason: why the variant was selected (rule match, weighted hash, or default). 
- meta: optional telemetry like evaluation duration or rule id.
- context: attributes of the current user, device, or environment.

### Rule language

* Supported operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `in`, `&&`, `||`.
* Identifiers resolve from the context (e.g. `country` resolves to `context.country`).
* Literals may be strings, numbers or booleans.
* A built‑in function `rollout(p)` (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) performs a deterministic hash of `flag.key` and `context.userId` and returns `true` if the resulting value is less than `p`.
* Evaluation is first‑match wins; if no rule matches, the evaluator returns the flag’s `default` value.

### Deterministic rollout

Rollouts are sticky: the same `flag.key` and `userId` will always produce the same bucket.

1. Concatenate `flag.key + ":" + context.userId`.
2. Hash the result using a small, deterministic 32‑bit FNV‑1a hash.
3. Divide the hash by `2^32` to obtain a value in the range [0, 1).
4. `rollout(p)` returns `true` if the value is strictly less than `p`.

The `contracts/` directory contains illustrative JSON Schemas to document the input and output structure.  These schemas are intentionally simple and do not cover all possible edge cases.

## Building and running

This example is split into two Rust crates: a core library (`ff_eval_core`) and a WASI executable (`ff_eval_wasi_app`).  The core contains all evaluation logic and has no dependencies beyond the standard library.  The WASI executable uses `serde` and `serde_json` to parse the input and serialize the output.

### Requirements

You will need a working Rust toolchain and (optionally) a Node.js runtime if you wish to run the provided adapters.  To execute the compiled WebAssembly module outside of Node you can install a dedicated WASI runtime such as Wasmtime or Wasmer.

* **Rust toolchain:** Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).  On macOS, Linux and Windows this single installer sets up `cargo`, `rustc` and related tools.  After installation open a new shell and verify with `cargo --version`.
* **Node.js (optional):** The edge and cloud adapters are written for Node.js and use Node’s built‑in [`wasi`](https://nodejs.org/api/wasi.html) module to execute the evaluator.  Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or via your system’s package manager and verify installation with `node --version`.  Node 16 or later is recommended.
* **WASI runtime (optional):** To run the compiled WebAssembly module outside of Node—for example from a shell—you can install [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) or [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer).  On macOS you can install Wasmtime via `brew install wasmtime`; on Linux download a release from the project’s GitHub page and extract it somewhere on your `PATH`; on Windows download the Wasmtime zip archive and add the extracted directory to your `PATH`.  Verify installation with `wasmtime --version`.

### Environment setup

Once you have Rust installed you need to add the `wasm32-wasip1` compilation target and install a WASI runtime.  The exact steps differ slightly between operating systems.

**macOS**

1. Add the WASI target:

   ```sh
   rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
   ```

2. (Optional) Install a standalone WASI runtime via Homebrew if you wish to run the `.wasm` outside of Node:

   ```sh
   brew install wasmtime
   ```

3. Install Node.js if you plan to use the Node adapters:

   ```sh
   brew install node
   ```

4. Verify that `node --version` succeeds.  If you installed Wasmtime, verify `wasmtime --version` as well.

**Linux**

1. Add the WASI compilation target:

   ```sh
   rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
   ```

2. (Optional) Download a [Wasmtime release](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) for Linux, extract the archive into a directory (for example `~/bin/wasmtime`) and ensure that directory is in your `PATH`.  You can also install Wasmtime via your package manager if available.

3. Install Node.js via your package manager.  For example on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install nodejs`.

4. Verify `node --version`.  If you installed Wasmtime, verify `wasmtime --version`.

**Windows**

1. Add the WASI compilation target in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
   ```

2. (Optional) Download the Windows Wasmtime zip from the [Wasmtime releases page](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases).  Extract it to a directory (for example `C:\wasmtime`) and add this directory to your `PATH` if you plan to run the `.wasm` outside of Node.

3. Install Node.js via the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if you plan to run the Node adapters.

4. Verify that `node --version` works from a new terminal.  If you installed Wasmtime, verify `wasmtime --version`.

After completing the above steps you can build the project and run the examples as described below.

To build the WASI binary directly:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 -p ff_eval_wasi_app
```

The compiled WebAssembly module will be written to
`target/wasm32-wasip1/release/ff_eval_wasi_app.wasm`.

### Running unit tests

The core library includes a suite of unit tests that exercise equality, rollout, membership, numeric comparisons and logical operators.  To run them use:

```sh
cargo test -p ff_eval_core
```

This command will compile the library and run all tests.  You should see output indicating that all tests have passed.

### Executing test vectors

Three JSON files under `tests/vectors/` demonstrate typical inputs and expected outcomes.  A convenience script is provided under `scripts/run_vectors.sh` to pipe each vector into the evaluator via `wasmtime`.

```sh
./scripts/run_vectors.sh
```

Ensure you have built the WASI module first (`cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 -p ff_eval_wasi_app`) and that `wasmtime` is installed and on your `PATH`.

### Running locally with wasmtime or wasmer

Assuming you have [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) or [wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) installed, you can run the evaluator on a JSON file.  For example:

```sh
echo '{"flag":{"key":"paywall","rules":[{"if":"country == \'CA\'","then":true},{"if":"rollout(0.20)","then":true}],"default":false},"context":{"userId":"u123","country":"CA"}}' \
| wasmtime target/wasm32-wasip1/release/ff_eval_wasi_app.wasm
```

This should print `{"key":"paywall","enabled":true,"matchedRule":0}`.  If the input cannot be parsed, the process exits with status 1.

### Browser and other environments
Running a WASI module in a browser requires a JavaScript polyfill that implements the WASI system interface.  This repository now includes a minimal browser adapter at `adapters/browser/ff.js` and a sample HTML page at `adapters/browser/index.html`.  The adapter defines an `evaluateFlag` function that:

1. Fetches the compiled WebAssembly module (`ff_eval_wasi_app.wasm`) relative to the HTML page.
2. Provides a minimal WASI implementation in JavaScript to supply stdin, stdout, environment variables and clocks.
3. Writes the input JSON to stdin, invokes the module’s `_start` function and collects the JSON output from stdout.

To run the browser demo:

1. Build the WASI module:

   ```sh
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 -p ff_eval_wasi_app
   ```

2. Copy the compiled module into the `adapters/browser` directory (for example using `cp target/wasm32-wasip1/release/ff_eval_wasi_app.wasm adapters/browser/`).

3. Open `adapters/browser/index.html` in a web server that supports ES modules (for example `python3 -m http.server`) and click “Evaluate” to run the evaluator in your browser.

Two Node‑based adapters are provided:

* **Edge worker (`adapters/edge/worker.ts`)**: This file exports a `fetch` function suitable for use in a Cloudflare Worker or similar environment.  It uses Node’s built‑in `wasi` module to instantiate and run the compiled WebAssembly module, feeding stdin/stdout through temporary files because modern Node expects numeric file descriptors for WASI stdio.  The worker reads the incoming request body as JSON and returns the evaluator’s stdout as the response.

* **Cloud handler (`adapters/cloud/handler.ts`)**: This file defines an AWS Lambda–style handler that uses Node’s `wasi` API.  Like the edge worker it executes the compiled module with temporary stdio files, returns the JSON output on success, and expects the compiled `.wasm` file to reside in `target/wasm32-wasip1/release/ff_eval_wasi_app.wasm`.  If the input is invalid JSON or the module fails, it returns a 400 or 500 status accordingly.

For environments that support Deno or other runtimes, you can adapt these examples by replacing the Node‑specific APIs with appropriate equivalents and ensuring that a WASI implementation (either built‑in or via a polyfill) is available.

## Troubleshooting

- `Missing required command: wasmtime`
  Install Wasmtime and make sure it is on your `PATH`.
- `error: wasm module not found`
  Run `cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1 -p ff_eval_wasi_app`.
- `Unknown lab`
  Run `./scripts/list_labs.sh` to see the supported Chapter 4 labs.
- TypeScript parity mismatch
  Run `npm test --prefix ts` and then `./scripts/compare_impls.sh` to narrow the failure to a specific lab.

## Value check

After finishing the Chapter 4 labs, a reader should be able to explain:

- why the Rust core is portable across hosts
- why deterministic rollout behavior has to live in the portable logic, not in an adapter
- how the same contract can be kept in parity across Rust and TypeScript
- why host adapters should stay thin around the evaluator instead of owning rule semantics

## Extending the evaluator

The provided implementation is intentionally small.  For a more complete feature set, you might consider adding:

* Additional operators (`!=`, `<`, `>`, `in`, `&&`, `||`).
* A hand‑written parser or combinator parser to build an AST rather than using ad‑hoc string matching.
* Weighted variants and multiple buckets.
* Time windows and scheduling of flags.
* Segments loaded by the adapter rather than bundled into the flag.
* Remote configuration fetched by the adapter.
* Audit logging in the cloud adapter (never inside the WASM module).

These are left as exercises to the reader and future work.

This repository now includes support for inequality and numeric comparison operators, the `in` operator and logical `&&` and `||` operators.  The implementation lives in `core/src/lib.rs`, and there are unit tests demonstrating how these operators work.  To extend the evaluator further—for example to support arrays in the context, nested parentheses or more complex operators—you can modify `eval_expr`, `parse_term_as_value` and the helper functions defined at the bottom of the core module.  Remember to add corresponding tests.
